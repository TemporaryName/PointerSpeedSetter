Merely a wrapper for calling the SystemParametersInfo function for SPI_SETMOUSESPEED/SETMOUSE to set one of the twenty mouse speed levels (Control Panel only lets you access half of those) as well as letting you edit and visualize the Registry's SmoothMouseX/YCurve or apply MarkC's fix for different configs.

The linearization also compensates for Window's 16.16 fixed point binary truncation errors (MarkC fix).
